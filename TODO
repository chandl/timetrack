Features:
* Enforce maximum notes size. (80 characters) ** check before creating report??
* Add db backup logic (every 15 minutes?)
** Add web UI to allow bulk import of times from CSV. -- low prio - script does this now
*** Add logic to un-merge entries (not as important)
* Smart merge (suggest merging items that have similar notes)

* Create an account system so I can test on 'prod'

* Allow merging times with different service items -- alert user

BUGS: 
- create time outside of report range, change time to be in report range, it does not get automatically added to report

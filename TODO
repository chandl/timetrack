Features:
* After merging times, show an edit window where user can update the notes.
* Enforce maximum notes size. (80 characters) ** check before creating report??
* Increase the default page size to 25 on report week.
* Add db backup logic (every 15 minutes?)
* Add web UI to allow bulk import of times from CSV.
* Add logic to un-merge entries (not as important)

BUGS: 
* When creating a report, each week, companies are sorted by number of entries. 
    If many entries are merged for a company, and then that company has <= entries 
    of one above it in the list, the list will update and user will lose their place. 
* You can't properly sort by time in the weekly tables

Features:
* After merging times, show an edit window where user can update the notes.
* Enforce maximum notes size. (80 characters) ** check before creating report??
* Increase the default page size to 25 on report week.
* Add db backup logic (every 15 minutes?)
* Add web UI to allow bulk import of times from CSV.
* Add logic to un-merge entries (not as important)
* Smart merge (suggest merging items that have similar notes)

* Create an account system so I can test on 'prod'
